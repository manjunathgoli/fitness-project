            <h3>SHOULDERS</h3>
            <p>Shoulder exercises help build strength and stability in the muscles around your shoulders. Start with shoulder presses using dumbbells or a barbell, lifting weights above your head while standing or sitting. Side lateral raises involve lifting weights out to the sides to target the outer shoulder muscles. Front raises focus on the front of the shoulders, lifting weights straight in front of you. Additionally, bent-over lateral raises help work the rear deltoids, lifting weights to the sides while bending forward. Incorporate these exercises into your routine, aiming for 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions each to improve shoulder strength and definition effectively.</p>

            <h3>BICEP</h3>
            <p>To work your biceps effectively, start with a basic exercise called bicep curls. Grab a pair of dumbbells, stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart. Hold the dumbbells at your sides with your palms facing forward. Keep your elbows close to your body and slowly lift the dumbbells towards your shoulders while exhaling. Squeeze your biceps at the top of the movement, then slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position while inhaling. Aim for 3 sets of 10-12 repetitions. Remember to start with a weight that challenges you but allows you to maintain proper form throughout the exercise.</p>
