            <h1 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">The Best Core Exercises for All Fitness Levels</h1>
            <h2 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Benefits of working out</h2>
            <p style="margin: 20px 20px;">Core exercises can include yoga poses, crunches, planks, and other exercises that incorporate additional muscles.</p>
            <h2 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Beginner moves</h2>
            <p style="margin: auto 20px;">If you’re new to exercise or if you haven’t exercised in a long time, start with these beginner moves.<br><br>

                It may also be a good idea to consult with a personal trainer, if you can, to talk about the right amount of reps and sets for your personal fitness level and goals.<BR><br>
                
                Throughout these exercises, you’ll see the phrase “tighten your core” — but how do you know if you’re actually doing that?<br>
                
                One good way to start is to inhale, and as you’re doing that, imagine you’re bringing your belly button toward your spine. Hold your muscles tight in that position for a few seconds.<br>
                
                This feeling of braced stomach muscles is what it feels like to engage — or tighten — your core.</p>

            <h3>Bridge</h3>
            <img src="bestexe-img/img-1.png">
            <p>This pose activates your glutes to lift your hips, which helps train your core while toning your butt and thighs.

                1.Start on your back. Bend your knees and plant your feet on the floor at hip width. Place your hands at your sides, palms down.
                2.Tighten your core and glutes.
                3.Raise your hips until your knees are in line with your shoulders.
                4.Hold for 10–30 seconds.
                5.Repeat 3–5 times.<br></p>

                <h3>Crunch</h3>
                <p>Start on your back. Bend your knees and plant your feet on the floor at hip width. Line up your head and spine. Cross your arms across your chest.<br>
                    Tighten your core and relax your neck and shoulders. Tuck in your chin and lift your upper back, keeping your lower back, pelvis, and feet on the floor. Pause.<br>
                    Slowly lower your upper back to return to the starting position.<br>
                    Start with 1 set of 8–12 reps.<br></p>
                <img src="bestexe-img/img-2.png">
                <p>1.Start in a plank position. Your core should be tight, shoulders pulled down and back, and your neck neutral.<br>
                    2.Bend your elbows and begin to lower your body down to the floor. When your chest grazes it, extend your elbows and return to the start. Focus on keeping your elbows close to your body during the movement.<br>
                    3.Complete 3 sets of as many reps as possible.<br>
                    If you can’t quite perform a standard pushup with good form, drop down to a modified stance on your knees — you’ll still reap many of the benefits from this exercise while building strength.<br></p>

                    <h3>Supine toe tap</h3>
                    <p>This is a basic Pilates exercise. It engages your core muscles while working your glutes, hips, and legs.<br><br>

                        Toe taps also place minimal pressure on your spine. If you have back pain, toe taps may be an ideal alternative to crunches.</p>

                        <p>The bird dog engages both your abdominal and back muscles, so it’s an ideal core-strengthening move. It also challenges your coordination, balance, and stability.</p>

                            3.Pause.
                            4.Repeat with your left leg and right arm.

                                5.As your right knee moves farther in, lift your left shoulder off the floor and move your left elbow toward your right knee.<br>
